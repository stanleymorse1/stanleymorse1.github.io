			<p>An endless runner game with a character you can’t control, players must guide and protect their robot by drawing platforms on screen to avoid obstacles and collect energy to get as far as they can.</p>
			<img src="Media/Main/SplineDraw.png">
			<p>Due to the game's physics-based nature, players must learn to use the character's momentum by drawing curved ramps of the right angle to conserve their limited spline drawing energy, which will prevent drawing when exhausted. Their aim is to get as far as possible while preventing the robot from slowing down, dropping into lava, hitting a deadly obstacle or coming to a halt; all of which will cause the robot to overheat and explode. Players have to constantly make split-second decisions, such as how to conserve energy, wether to take risks to collect the precious batteries to replenish spline energy, wether to prioritize distance or coins, would it be safer to go over or under an obstacle etc.</p>
			<img src="Media/Main/SplineDraw.png">
			<p>Optimized for mobile, spline-rider is a very lightweight, simple and easy to pick up. It features a one button control scheme – the only way to play is to draw on the screen, but procedurally generated obstacles make for interesting challenges and plenty of emergent gameplay.</p>
			<img src="Media/Main/SplineDraw.png">
			<p>This main gameplay loop was iteratively redesigned with feedback from testers, resulting in an addictive and rewarding game experience that can be played in short bursts or for longer sessions.</p>
			<p>Spline rider will be available on PC and Android devices later this year. If you would like a preview build or gameplay demonstration please reach out.</p>
